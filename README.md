# Nomelette data

This is a temporary repo for working with the nomelette data while I try to figure out how to get it uploaded to dynamo.

The `data` folder contains some raw data that used to be in a database (postgres)

The purpose of this repo is to create a script to take that data and insert it into dynamo.
